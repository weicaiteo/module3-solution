It is raised widely for its meat and eggs.[1] There are 24 billion chickens worldwide.[2] They are usually kept by humans as livestock, which means it is kept for its meat and eggs. Most breeds of chickens can fly for short distances and some roost in trees if these are provided.

A male chicken is called a rooster or a cock (short for cockerel). A female chicken is called a hen. A young chicken is called a chick. Like other female birds, hens lay eggs which can hatch into a chick

When raising chickens, a farmer needs to build a chicken Nest (like a little house) for his chickens to roost (sleep) in. They also need a run or yard where they can exercise, take dust baths, eat, and drink. The chickens also need to be protected from predators such as foxes, which is often done with fences. [3]

Chickens can also be farmed intensively. This lets farms make a lot of chicken meat and eggs, but this is not as good for the chickens.
Because of the low cost, chicken meat (also called "chicken") is one of the most used kinds of meat in the world. Americans eat 8 billion chickens every year.[5] The most popular dishes with chicken are Buffalo wings, butter chicken, chicken rice, chicken balls, chicken pot pie, chicken soup, fried chicken (see picture), roasted chicken, and tandoori chicken.
Despite the chicken’s close relationship with the red jungle fowl, there is evidence that the gray jungle fowl (G. sonneratii) of southern India and other jungle fowl species, also members of Gallus, may have contributed to the bird’s ancestry. There is some debate about what the chicken’s scientific name should be. Although ... (100 of 885 words)

Beef is popular in the United States. Beef derives from the German word 'beife', meaning grazing beast. Beef can also mean a rivalry or feud between people in slang.Steak (not to be confused with 'stake') is a slice off a larger piece of meat, usually beef. In North America, steaks are usually grilled. They are also often pan-fried or broiled. The most tender (softest) cuts of the animal are usually used for steak. This also means that steaks have a high price. The pieces of meat used for steaks are usually cut across the muscle fiber, not along it. This makes them appear more tender.

A restaurant that mainly makes steaks is known as a steakhouse. A well-known side dish to steak is prawns or a cooked lobster tail. This combination is often called surf and turf or reef and beef (the words "surf" and "reef" refer to the seafood and "turf" and "beef" refer to the steak). Special steak knives are used to cut steak. A steak knife is sharper than most table knives and is usually serrated.

Fish is not the only side dish for steak. Other common side dishes are baked potatoes, dinner rolls, salad, and corn on the cob. In France, steaks are often served with french fries. This combination is known as steak fries or steak-frites. They do not come with vegetables, but sometimes a salad is served with them.

Often, steaks are served with a special sauce called "steak sauce", but sometimes steaks are served with a spicy sauce called horseradish

A common cut of steak is between 4 and 12 ozs, but some places serve steaks that are much, much bigger.
Ground beef is a ground meat made of beef. it is used in many recipes including hamburgers and cottage pie.
Corned beef is a cut of beef that has been pickled or cured in brine. Corned beef is a common meat in deli sandwiches. Corned beef is eaten by people on Saint Patrick's Day with cabbage.

      <h3 class="text-center">Sushi</h3>

Netus et malesuada fames ac!Sushi (???) is a traditional food from Japan. It is a popular dish in other countries as well, such as America, Canada, and the UK, along with many other countries.

Sushi is made with specially prepared rice. The rice is mixed with vinegar, salt, and sugar. Sushi also contains raw or cooked seafood, and sometimes vegetables as well. Sometimes sushi is wrapped in a sheet of seaweed called nori.

There are many different kinds of sushi. The most common sushi in Japan is nigirizushi: fish that is placed on top of a small portion of sushi rice. Sometimes you may find other ingredients on top of rice, such as egg instead of fish. Makizushi consists of rice rolled around fish and/or vegetables. In America, makizushi is more popular than nigirizushi. Another type is known as temaki or a hand roll. This kind of sushi comes in a cone-shape, created by the nori wrapped around the ingredients inside. They are usually filled with a mixture of rice, fish, and vegetables.

Sushi can be eaten with hands or chopsticks. Soy sauce and wasabi are commonly eaten with sushi. Gari (sweet, pickled ginger) can often be found alongside a plate of sushi, used as a palate cleanser.

In Japan, sushi is sometimes sold in "conveyor-belt shops" called kaiten zushi, where plates of sushi are put on a moving belt that passes by the customers. People freely take the sushi they want as it passes. The color of the plate shows the price of the sushi. This way of serving sushi is becoming more popular in other countries as well.
The origin of sushi goes back to Southeast Asia around the 4th century B.C.. In that time, it was called 'narezushi'. Originally the fish was eaten alone, without rice. Then, a style of sushi called 'namanarezushi' reached Japan. 'Namanarezushi' combined the fish with rice.

What we call "sushi" today, was created by Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858) at the end of the Edo period in Edo. Sushi invented by Hanaya was an early form of fast food that was not fermented (therefore prepared quickly) and could be easily eaten with one's hands. Originally, this sushi was known as Edomae zushi because it used freshly caught fish in the Edo-mae (Edo Bay or Tokyo Bay). Though the fish used in modern sushi no longer usually comes from Tokyo Bay, it is still formally known as Edomae nigirizushi.
As with most foods, eating sushi has some health risks. However, most can be minimized with proper preparation. Some large fish, such as tuna (especially bluefin), can contain high levels of mercury. Tuna can cause mercury poisoning when consumed in very large quantities over time. Parasite infection by raw fish is not common in the modern world (less than 40 cases per year in the U.S.). Infections can generally be avoided by boiling, burning, preserving in salt or vinegar, or freezing to a certain temperature. Although nigirizushi will almost always appear in a raw form, often much of the fish has been previously frozen to specific temperatures to prevent parasites.
